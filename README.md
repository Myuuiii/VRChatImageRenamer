# VRChat Image Renamer

Will create new names for all images in the VRChat folder, even if they are in subfolders. The new names will make it so they are always on chronological order if they are ordered by name.

## Getting started

-   Download the latest version of VRChatImageRenamer from the [releases page](https://github.com/Myuuiii/VRChatImageRenamer/releases).
-   Put the `.jar` file in any folder.
-   Double click on the jar file to run.
-   Note that this will not create a backup of your images. If you want to test this out, please make sure to create a backup.

## Format

Any `.png` image in the VRChat folder or any of its subdirectories will be renamed to the following format: `VRChat_<unix timestamp>_<width>x<height>.png`
